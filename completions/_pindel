        {-i,--config-file}'[the bam config file; either this, a pindel input file, or a pindel config file is required. Per line: path and file name of bam, insert size and sample tag. For example: /data/tumour.bam 400 tumour]':file:_files \
        {-o,--output-prefix}'[Output prefix;]':file:_files \
        {-P,--pindel-config-file}'[the pindel config file, containing the names of all Pindel files that need to be sampled; either this, a bam config file or a pindel input file is required. Per line: path and file name of pindel input. Example: /data/tumour.txt]' \
        {-c,--chromosome}'[Which chr/fragment. Pindel will process reads for one chromosome each time. ChrName must be the same as in reference sequence and in read file. '\''-c ALL'\'' will make Pindel loop over all chromosomes. The search for indels and SVs can also be limited to a specific region; -c 20:10,000,000 will only look for indels and SVs after position 10,000,000 = \[10M, end\], -c 20:5,000,000-15,000,000 will report indels in the range between and including the bases at position 5,000,000 and 15,000,000 = \[5M, 15M\]. (default ALL)]' \
        {-h,--help}'[show the command line options of Pindel]' \
        {-R,--RP}'[search for discordant read-pair to improve sensitivity (default true)]' \
        {-H,--min_distance_to_the_end}'[the minimum number of bases required to match reference (default 8).]' \
        {-T,--number_of_threads}'[the number of threads Pindel will use (default 1).]' \
        {-x,--max_range_index}'[the maximum size of structural variations to be detected; the higher this number, the greater the number of SVs reported, but the computational cost and memory requirements increase, as does the rate of false positives. 1=128, 2=512, 3=2,048, 4=8,092, 5=32,368, 6=129,472, 7=517,888, 8=2,071,552, 9=8,286,208. (maximum 9, default 2)]' \
        {-w,--window_size}'[for saving RAM, divides the reference in bins of X million bases and only analyzes the reads that belong in the current bin, (default 5 (=5 million))]' \
        {-e,--sequencing_error_rate}'[the expected fraction of sequencing errors (default 0.01)]' \
        {-E,--sensitivity}'[Pindel only reports reads if they can be fit around an event within a certain number of mismatches. If the fraction of sequencing errors is 0.01, (so we'\''d expect a total error rate of 0.011 since on average 1 in 1000 bases is a SNP) and pindel calls a deletion, but there are 4 mismatched bases in the new fit of the pindel read (100 bases) to the reference genome, Pindel would calculate that with an error rate of 0.01 (=0.011 including SNPs) the chance that there are 0, 1 or 2 mismatched bases in the reference genome is 90%. Setting -E to .90 (=90%) will thereforethrow away all reads with 3 or more mismatches, even though that means that you throw away 1 in 10 valid reads. Increasing this parameter to say 0.99 will increase the sensitivity of pindel though you may get more false positives, decreasing the parameter ensures you only get very good matches but pindel may not find as many events. (default 0.95)]' \
        {-u,--maximum_allowed_mismatch_rate}'[Only reads with more than this fraction of mismatches than the reference genome will be considered as harboring potential SVs. (default 0.02)]' \
        {-n,--NM}'[the minimum number of edit distance between reads and reference genome (default 2). reads at least NM edit distance (>= NM) will be realigned]' \

        {-k,--report_breakpoints}'[report breakpoints (default false)]' \
        {-s,--report_close_mapped_reads}'[report reads of which only one end (the one closest to the mapped read of the paired-end read) could be mapped. (default false)]' \
        {-S,--report_only_close_mapped_reads}'[do not search for SVs, only report reads of which only one end (the one closest to the mapped read of the paired-end read) could be mapped (the output file can then be used as an input file for another run of pindel, which may save size if you need to transfer files). (default false)]' \
        {-I,--report_interchromosomal_events}'[search for interchromosomal events. Note: will require the computer to have at least 4 GB of memory (default false)]' \
        {-C,--IndelCorrection}'[search for consensus indels to corret contigs (default false)]' \
        {-N,--NormalSamples}'[Turn on germline filtering, less sensistive and you may miss somatic calls (default false)]' \
        {-b,--breakdancer}'[Pindel is able to use calls from other SV methods such as BreakDancer to further increase sensitivity and specificity. BreakDancer result or calls from any methods must in the format: ChrA LocA stringA ChrB LocB stringB other]' \

        {-a,--additional_mismatch}'[Pindel will only map part of a read to the reference genome if there are no other candidate positions with no more than the specified number of mismatches position. The bigger the value, the more accurate but less sensitive. (minimum value 1, default value 1)]' \
        {-m,--min_perfect_match_around_BP}'[at the point where the read is split into two, there should at least be this number of perfectly matching bases between read and reference (default value 3)]' \

        {-d,--min_num_matched_bases}'[only consider reads as evidence if they map with more than X bases to the reference. (default 30)]' \
        {-B,--balance_cutoff}'[the number of bases of a SV above which a more stringent filter is applied which demands that both sides of the SV are mapped with sufficiently long strings of bases (default 100)]' \
        {-A,--anchor_quality}'[the minimal mapping quality of the reads Pindel uses as anchor If you only need high confident calls, set to 30 or higher(default 0)]' \

Format: chr Loc_left Loc_right size type index. For example, "1 72766323 72811840 45516 D 11970" means the deletion event chr1:72766323-72811840 of size 45516 is reported as an event with index 11970 in Pindel report of deletion.]' \
        {-L,--name_of_logfile}'[Specifies a file to write Pindel'\''s log to (default: no logfile, log is written to the screen/stdout)]' \
