This file can be used to set default values for command line options in YAML format. For example, '\''--cluster qsub'\'' becomes '\''cluster: qsub'\'' in the YAML file.

The tmpdir resource is automatically used by shell commands, scripts and wrappers to store temporary data (as it is mirrored into $TMPDIR, $TEMP, and $TMP for the executed subprocesses).

If you want to use these instances for a subset of your rules, you can use --preemptible-rules and then specify a list of rule and integer pairs, where each integer indicates the number of restarts to use for the rule'\''s instance in the case that the instance is terminated unexpectedly. --preemptible-rules can be used in combination with --preemption-default, and will take priority.

This is used to pretend that the rules were executed, in order to fool future invocations of snakemake. Fails if a file does not yet exist. Note that this will only touch files that would otherwise be recreated by Snakemake (e.g. because their input files are newer). For enforcing a touch, combine this with --force, --forceall, or --forcerun. Note however that you loose the provenance information when the files have been created in realitiy.
