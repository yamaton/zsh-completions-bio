        {-a,--adapter}'[Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 3'\'' end (paired data: of the first read). The adapter and subsequent bases are trimmed. If a '\''$'\'' character is appended ('\''anchoring'\''), the adapter is only found if it is a suffix of the read.]' \
        {-g,--front}'[Sequence of an adapter ligated to the 5'\'' end (paired data: of the first read). The adapter and any preceding bases are trimmed. Partial matches at the 5'\'' end are allowed. If a '\''^'\'' character is prepended ('\''anchoring'\''), the adapter is only found if it is a prefix of the read.]' \
        {-b,--anywhere}'[Sequence of an adapter that may be ligated to the 5'\'' or 3'\'' end (paired data: of the first read). Both types of matches as described under -a and -g are allowed. If the first base of the read is part of the match, the behavior is as with -g, otherwise as with -a. This option is mostly for rescuing failed library preparations - do not use if you know which end your adapter was ligated to!]' \
        {-e,--error-rate,--errors}'[Maximum allowed error rate (if 0 <= E < 1), or absolute number of errors for full-length adapter match (if E is an integer >= 1). Error rate = no. of errors divided by length of matching region. Default: 0.1 (10%)]' \
        '--no-indels[Allow only mismatches in alignments. Default: allow both mismatches and indels]' \

        {-u,--cut}'[Remove bases from each read (first read only if paired). If LENGTH is positive, remove bases from the beginning. If LENGTH is negative, remove bases from the end. Can be used twice if LENGTHs have different signs. This is applied *before* adapter trimming.]' \
        '--nextseq-trim[NextSeq-specific quality trimming (each read). Trims also dark cycles appearing as high-quality G bases.]' \
        {-q,--quality-cutoff}'[Trim low-quality bases from 5'\'' and/or 3'\'' ends of each read before adapter removal. Applied to both reads if data is paired. If one value is given, only the 3'\'' end is trimmed. If two comma-separated cutoffs are given, the 5'\'' end is trimmed with the first cutoff, the 3'\'' end with the second.]' \
        '--quality-base[Assume that quality values in FASTQ are encoded as ascii(quality + N). This needs to be set to 64 for some old Illumina FASTQ files. Default: 33]' \
        {--length,-l}'[Shorten reads to LENGTH. Positive values remove bases at the end while negative ones remove bases at the beginning. This and the following modifications are applied after adapter trimming.]' \
        '--trim-n[Trim N'\''s on ends of reads.]' \
        '--length-tag[Search for TAG followed by a decimal number in the description field of the read. Replace the decimal number with the correct length of the trimmed read. For example, use --length-tag '\''length='\'' to correct fields like '\''length=123'\''.]' \
        '--strip-suffix[Remove this suffix from read names if present. Can be given multiple times.]' \
        {-x,--prefix}'[Add this prefix to read names. Use {name} to insert the name of the matching adapter.]' \
