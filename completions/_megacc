        {-c,--calibration}'[Specify the full path to a calibration file that you wish to use. The calibration file is used to provide calibration data for tree timing methods.]':file:_files \
        {-ca,--concatenate-alignments}'[Command to concatenate multiple sequence alignments into a single sequence alignment file The files to be concatenated should either be located in a directory specified by the -d option or the -l option can be used to specify the files to concatenate via a text file that has the full path to each file on a separate line.]' \
        {-d,--data}'[(*required for most analyses*) Specify the full or relative path to the data file you wish to analyze. MEGA (.meg), and Fasta files are supported for all analyses. For distance matrices the MEGA (.meg) format is required.]':file:_files \
        {-date-format,--date-format}'[Specify a date format for parsing tip dates from taxa names when doing the RTDT analysis. If tip dates (sample times) are encoded in taxa names, MEGA can try to parse those dates and auto-generate tip date calibrations. The set of valid characters for the date format is {y m d - /} Examples of valid date formats are:]' \
        {-f,--format}'[Export format for sequence alignment Sequence alignments can be exported in either the native .meg or FASTA format.]' \
        {-find-tip-dates,--find-tip-dates}'[Parse tip dates from taxa names and generate a file that contains auto-generated sample time calibration constraints that can be later used for running the RTDT (RelTime with Date Tips) analysis. This requires the -date-format parameter to be specified]' \
        {-g,--groups}'[Specify the full path to the groups file that you wish to use. This file organizes taxa into groups where each line in the file is a key value pair of the form]':file:_files \
        {-gs,--gap-symbol}'[The character that represents indels in the sequence data file that is being analyzed If this is provided, it will override the value that is provided in the .mao file]' \

        {-is,--identical-base-symbol}'[The character that represents identical bases in the sequence data file that is being analyzed If this is provided, it will override the value that is provided in the .mao file]' \
        {-l,--list}'[Specifies a text file which has a list of input data files to be analyzed. This option can be used instead of -d or -t to specify input data, in which case, the same analysis will be performed on all input files listed in the text file and each output results files will be named using the name of its corresponding input file. The indicated text file must be formatted such that each line has the full path to the sequence data file to be used and if a tree file is also provided it is on the same line but separated by a two pipe characters (e.g. || ). See EXAMPLES and LIST FORMAT below.]':file:_files \
        {-ms,--missing-base-symbol}'[The character that represents missing bases in the sequence data file that is being analyzed If this is provided, it will override the value that is provided in the .mao file]' \
        {-n,--noSummary}'[By default a file that gives an analysis summary is written. This option suppresses the export of that file. However, if any important messages are generated by the application, they will be written to this file regardless.]' \
        {-o,--outfile}'[Specify the full path and base filename (e.g. /myResultsDirectory/myResultName) or simply the full path and directory of where to save the file (e.g. /myResultsDirectory) in which case, a unique filename will be chosen automatically for you.]':file:_files \
        {-pfc,--partition-frequency-cutoff}'[When bootstrapping is used for tree construction a list of partitions and frequencies is written to a text file. The partition frequency cutoff causes any partitions whose frequency is less than the cutoff value to be ommited from this text file. Set this value to 0.0 to include all partitions.]' \
        {-r,--recursive}'[If a directory is specified for analysis by default MEGA only searches the contents of that folder and not any of it'\''s children. To include the contents of all folders under the one specified, use this option.]' \
        {-s,--silent}'[This option prevents progress updates from being written to stdout.]' \
        {-t,--tree}'[(*required for some analyses*) Specify the full path to the tree file you wish to use. (Some analyses requires a user provided tree, or allow you to provide your own)]':file:_files \
