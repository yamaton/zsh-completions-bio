        '-i[provide a text file with a list of (query) GTF files to process instead of expecting them as command line arguments (useful when a large number of GTF files should be processed)]' \
        '-r[reference annotation file (GTF/GFF)]' \
        '-R[for -r option, consider only the reference transcripts that overlap any of the input transfrags (Sn correction)]' \
        '-Q[for -r option, consider only the input transcripts that overlap any of the reference transcripts (Precision correction); (Warning: this will discard all "novel" loci!)]' \
        '-M[discard (ignore) single-exon transfrags and reference transcripts]' \
        '-N[discard (ignore) single-exon reference transcripts]' \
        '-D[discard "duplicate" query transfrags (i.e. same intron chain) within a single sample (disable "annotation" mode for a single file); this option is automatically enabled when multiple query files are provided]' \
        '-S[when -D is enabled (or multiple query files are provided), perform a more strict duplicate checking: only discard matching (same intron chain) query transcripts from the same sample if their boundaries are fully contained within (or same with) matching transcripts if --strict-match is also given, exact match of all exons is required]' \
        {--no-exon-merge,--no-merge}'[disable close-exon merging (default: merge exons separated by "introns" shorter than 5 bases]' \
        '-s[to genome sequences (optional); this can be either a multi-FASTA file or a directory containing single-fasta files (one for each contig); repeats must be soft-masked (lower case) in order to be able to classify transfrags as repeats]':file:_files \
        '-o[output prefix]' \
        '-e[when estimating exon level accuracy, this is the maximum range variation allowed for the free ends of terminal exons (default 100); this terminal exon restriction applies to transcript level accuracy when --strict-match option is given]' \
        '--strict-match[transcript matching takes into account the -e range for terminal exons; code '\''='\'' is only assigned if transcript ends are within that range, otherwise code '\''~'\'' is assigned just for intron chain match (or significant overlap in the case of single exon transcripts)]' \
        '--cds-match[perform validation of CDS chain matching, for `=` and `~` cases this adds new classification codes '\'':'\'' and '\''_'\'' which replace '\''='\'' and '\''~'\'' when no matching CDS is found with this option activated]' \
        '-d[max distance (range) for grouping transcript start sites (100)]' \
        '-V[verbose processing mode (also shows GFF parser warnings)]' \

        '-C[discard matching and "contained" transfrags in the GTF output (i.e. collapse intron-redundant transfrags across all query files)]' \
        '-A[like -C but does not discard intron-redundant transfrags if they start with a different 5'\'' exon (possible alternate TSS; for the same first 5'\'' intron, minimum TSS distance is specified by -d option, default 100)]' \
        '-X[like -C but also discard contained transfrags even when transfrag ends stick out within the container'\''s introns (by at most 50 bases)]' \
        '--cset[for -C/-A/-X also discard single exon transfrags when fully contained in an exon of a multi-exon transfrag]' \
        '-K[for -C/-A/-X, do NOT discard any redundant transfrag matching a reference]' \
