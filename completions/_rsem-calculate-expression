    _arguments \
        '--paired-end[Input reads are paired-end reads. (Default: off)]' \
        '--no-qualities[Input reads do not contain quality scores. (Default: off)]' \
        '--strandedness[This option defines the strandedness of the RNA-Seq reads. It recognizes three values: '\''none'\'', '\''forward'\'', and '\''reverse'\''. '\''none'\'' refers to non-strand-specific protocols. '\''forward'\'' means all (upstream) reads are derived from the forward strand. '\''reverse'\'' means all (upstream) reads are derived from the reverse strand. If '\''forward'\''/'\''reverse'\'' is set, the '\''--norc'\''/'\''--nofw'\'' Bowtie/Bowtie 2 option will also be enabled to avoid aligning reads to the opposite strand. For Illumina TruSeq Stranded protocols, please use '\''reverse'\''. (Default: '\''none'\'')]' \
        {-p,--num-threads}'[Number of threads to use. Both Bowtie/Bowtie2, expression estimation and '\''samtools sort'\'' will use this many threads. (Default: 1)]' \
        '--alignments[Input file contains alignments in SAM/BAM/CRAM format. The exact file format will be determined automatically. (Default: off)]' \
        '--fai[If the header section of input alignment file does not contain reference sequence information, this option should be turned on. <file> is a FAI format file containing each reference sequence'\''s name and length. Please refer to the SAM official website for the details of FAI format. (Default: off)]':file:_files \
        '--bowtie2[Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align reads. Since currently RSEM does not handle indel, local and discordant alignments, the Bowtie2 parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments. In particular, we use options '\''--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999 --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1'\'' by default. The last parameter of '\''--score-min'\'', '\''-0.1'\'', is the negative of maximum mismatch rate. This rate can be set by option '\''--bowtie2-mismatch-rate'\''. If reads are paired-end, we additionally use options '\''--no-mixed'\'' and '\''--no-discordant'\''. (Default: off)]' \
        '--star[Use STAR to align reads. Alignment parameters are from ENCODE3'\''s STAR-RSEM pipeline. To save computational time and memory resources, STAR'\''s Output BAM file is unsorted. It is stored in RSEM'\''s temporary directory with name as '\''sample_name.bam'\''. Each STAR job will have its own private copy of the genome in memory. (Default: off)]' \
        '--hisat2-hca[Use HISAT2 to align reads to the transcriptome according to Human Cell Atlast SMART-Seq2 pipeline. In particular, we use HISAT parameters "-k 10 --secondary --rg-id=$sampleToken --rg SM:$sampleToken --rg LB:$sampleToken --rg PL:ILLUMINA --rg PU:$sampleToken --new-summary --summary-file $sampleName.log --met-file $sampleName.hisat2.met.txt --met 5 --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1 --rdg 99999999,99999999 --rfg 99999999,99999999 --no-spliced-alignment --no-softclip --seed 12345". If inputs are paired-end reads, we additionally use parameters "--no-mixed --no-discordant". (Default: off)]' \
        '--append-names[If gene_name/transcript_name is available, append it to the end of gene_id/transcript_id (separated by '\''_'\'') in files '\''sample_name.isoforms.results'\'' and '\''sample_name.genes.results'\''. (Default: off)]' \
        '--seed[Set the seed for the random number generators used in calculating posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. The seed must be a non-negative 32 bit integer. (Default: off)]' \
        '--single-cell-prior[By default, RSEM uses Dirichlet(1) as the prior to calculate posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. However, much less genes are expressed in single cell RNA-Seq data. Thus, if you want to compute posterior mean estimates and/or credibility intervals and you have single-cell RNA-Seq data, you are recommended to turn on this option. Then RSEM will use Dirichlet(0.1) as the prior which encourage the sparsity of the expression levels. (Default: off)]' \
        '--calc-pme[Run RSEM'\''s collapsed Gibbs sampler to calculate posterior mean estimates. (Default: off)]' \

        '--version[Show version information.]' \
        '--sort-bam-by-read-name[Sort BAM file aligned under transcript coordidate by read name. Setting this option on will produce deterministic maximum likelihood estimations from independent runs. Note that sorting will take long time and lots of memory. (Default: off)]' \
        '--no-bam-output[Do not output any BAM file. (Default: off)]' \
        '--sampling-for-bam[When RSEM generates a BAM file, instead of outputting all alignments a read has with their posterior probabilities, one alignment is sampled according to the posterior probabilities. The sampling procedure includes the alignment to the "noise" transcript, which does not appear in the BAM file. Only the sampled alignment has a weight of 1. All other alignments have weight 0. If the "noise" transcript is sampled, all alignments appeared in the BAM file should have weight 0. (Default: off)]' \
        '--output-genome-bam[Generate a BAM file, '\''sample_name.genome.bam'\'', with alignments mapped to genomic coordinates and annotated with their posterior probabilities. In addition, RSEM will call samtools (included in RSEM package) to sort and index the bam file. '\''sample_name.genome.sorted.bam'\'' and '\''sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai'\'' will be generated. (Default: off)]' \
        '--sort-bam-by-coordinate[Sort RSEM generated transcript and genome BAM files by coordinates and build associated indices. (Default: off)]' \
        '--sort-bam-memory-per-thread[Set the maximum memory per thread that can be used by '\''samtools sort'\''. <string> represents the memory and accepts suffices '\''K/M/G'\''. RSEM will pass <string> to the '\''-m'\'' option of '\''samtools sort'\''. Note that the default used here is different from the default used by samtools. (Default: 1G)]' \
        '--seed-length[Seed length used by the read aligner. Providing the correct value is important for RSEM. If RSEM runs Bowtie, it uses this value for Bowtie'\''s seed length parameter. Any read with its or at least one of its mates'\'' (for paired-end reads) length less than this value will be ignored. If the references are not added poly(A) tails, the minimum allowed value is 5, otherwise, the minimum allowed value is 25. Note that this script will only check if the value >= 5 and give a warning message if the value < 25 but >= 5. (Default: 25)]' \
        '--phred33-quals[Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+33. This option is used by Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and HISAT2. (Default: on)]' \
        '--phred64-quals[Input quality scores are encoded as Phred+64 (default for GA Pipeline ver. >= 1.3). This option is used by Bowtie, Bowtie 2 and HISAT2. (Default: off)]' \

        '--bowtie2-sensitivity-level[(Bowtie 2 parameter) Set Bowtie 2'\''s preset options in --end-to-end mode. This option controls how hard Bowtie 2 tries to find alignments. <string> must be one of "very_fast", "fast", "sensitive" and "very_sensitive". The four candidates correspond to Bowtie 2'\''s "--very-fast", "--fast", "--sensitive" and "--very-sensitive" options. (Default: "sensitive" - use Bowtie 2'\''s default)]' \

        '--fragment-length-sd[(single-end data only) The standard deviation of the fragment length distribution, which is assumed to be a Gaussian. (Default: 0, which assumes that all fragments are of the same length, given by the rounded value of --fragment-length-mean)]' \
