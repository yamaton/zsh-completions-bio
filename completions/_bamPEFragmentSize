Larger numbers are sufficient for high coverage samples, while smaller values are useful for lower coverage samples. Note that if you specify a value that results in too few (<1000) reads sampled, the value will be decreased. (Default: 1000000)]' \
        {--blackListFileName,-bl}'[A BED file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered.]':file:_files \
