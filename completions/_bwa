            '-w[Band width. Essentially, gaps longer than INT will not be found. Note that the maximum gap length is also affected by the scoring matrix and the hit length, not solely determined by this option. \[100\]]' \
            '-d[Off-diagonal X-dropoff (Z-dropoff). Stop extension when the difference between the best and the current extension score is above |i-j|*A+INT, where i and j are the current positions of the query and reference, respectively, and A is the matching score. Z-dropoff is similar to BLAST'\''s X-dropoff except that it doesn'\''t penalize gaps in one of the sequences in the alignment. Z-dropoff not only avoids unnecessary extension, but also reduces poor alignments inside a long good alignment. \[100\]]' \
            '-r[Trigger re-seeding for a MEM longer than minSeedLen*FLOAT. This is a key heuristic parameter for tuning the performance. Larger value yields fewer seeds, which leads to faster alignment speed but lower accuracy. \[1.5\]]' \

            '-E[Gap extension penalty. If two numbers are specified, the first is the penalty of extending a deletion and second for extending an insertion. A gap of length k costs O + k*E (i.e. -O is for opening a zero-length gap). \[1\]]' \
            '-L[Clipping penalty. When performing SW extension, BWA-MEM keeps track of the best score reaching the end of query. If this score is larger than the best SW score minus the clipping penalty, clipping will not be applied.

If two numbers are provided, the first is for 5'\''-end clipping and second for 3'\''-end clipping. \[5\]]' \
            '-U[Penalty for an unpaired read pair. BWA-MEM scores an unpaired read pair as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-INT and scores a paired as scoreRead1+scoreRead2-insertPenalty.

Because the inferred insert size distribution slightly depends on the batch size, using different number of threads may produce different output. Specifying this option helps reproducibility.]' \

            '-C[Append FASTA/Q comment to SAM output. This option can be used to transfer read meta information (e.g. barcode) to the SAM output. Note that the FASTA/Q comment (the string after a space in the header line) must conform the SAM spec (e.g. BC:Z:CGTAC). Malformated comments lead to incorrect SAM output.]' \

            '-v[Control the verbosity level of the output. This option has not been fully supported throughout BWA.
