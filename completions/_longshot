        {-S,--stable_alignment}'[Use numerically-stable (logspace) pair HMM forward algorithm. Is significantly slower but may be more accurate. Tests have shown this not to be necessary for highly error prone reads (PacBio CLR).]' \

        {-v,--potential_variants}'[Genotype and phase the variants in this VCF instead of using pileup method to find variants. NOTES: VCF must be gzipped and tabix indexed or contain contig information. Use with caution because excessive false potential variants can lead to inaccurate results. Every variant is used and only the allele fields are considered -- Genotypes, filters, qualities etc are ignored. Indel variants will be genotyped but not phased. Triallelic variants and structural variants are currently not supported.]' \

        {-Q,--potential_snv_cutoff}'[Consider a site as a potential SNV if the original PHRED-scaled QUAL score for 0/0 genotype is below this amount (a larger value considers more potential SNV sites). \[default: 20.0\]]' \

        {-L,--hap_converge_delta}'[Terminate the haplotype/genotype iteration when the relative change in log-likelihood falls below this amount. Setting a larger value results in faster termination but potentially less accurate results. \[default: 0.0001\]]' \
        {-l,--anchor_length}'[Length of indel-free anchor sequence on the left and right side of read realignment window. \[default: 6\]]' \
        {-m,--max_snvs}'[Cut off variant clusters after this many variants. 2^m haplotypes must be aligned against per read for a variant cluster of size m. \[default: 3\]]' \

        {-D,--density_params}'[Parameters to flag a variant as part of a "dense cluster". Format <n>:<l>:<gq>. If there are at least n variants within l base pairs with genotype quality >=gq, then these variants are flagged as "dn" \[default: 10:500:50\]]' \
        {-s,--sample_id}'[Specify a sample ID to write to the output VCF \[default: SAMPLE\]]' \
