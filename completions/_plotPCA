        {-h,--help}'[show this help message and exit]' \
        '--transpose[Perform the PCA on the transposed matrix, (i.e., on the matrix where rows are samples and columns are bins/features. This then matches what is typically done in R.]' \
        '--rowCenter[When specified, each row (bin, gene, etc.) in the matrix is centered at 0 before the PCA is computed. This is useful only if you have a strong bin/gene/etc. correlation and the resulting principal component has samples stacked vertically. This option is not applicable if --transpose is specified.]' \
        {--corData,-in}'[Coverage file (generated by multiBamSummary or multiBigwigSummary)]':file:_files \
        {--plotFile,-o}'[File name to save the plot to. The extension determines the file format. For example: pca.pdf will save the PCA plot in PDF format. The available options are: .png, .eps, .pdf and .svg. If this option is omitted, then you MUST specify --outFileNameData]':file:_files \
        {--labels,-l}'[User defined labels instead of default labels from file names. Multiple labels have to be separated by spaces, e.g. --labels sample1 sample2 sample3]' \
        {--plotTitle,-T}'[Title of the plot, to be printed on top of the generated image. Leave blank for no title. (Default: )]' \
        '--plotFileFormat[Image format type. If given, this option overrides the image format based on the plotFile ending. The available options are: png, eps, pdf, plotly and svg.]':file:_files \
        '--plotHeight[Plot height in cm. (Default: 10)]' \
        '--plotWidth[Plot width in cm. The minimum value is 1 cm. (Default: 10)]' \
        '--outFileNameData[File name to which the data underlying the plot should be saved, such as myPCA.tab. For untransposed data, this is the loading per-sample and PC as well as the eigenvalues. For transposed data, this is the rotation per-sample and PC and the eigenvalues. The projections are truncated to the number of eigenvalues for transposed data.]':file:_files \
        '--ntop[Use only the top N most variable rows in the original matrix. Specifying 0 will result in all rows being used. If the matrix is to be transposed, rows with 0 variance are always excluded, even if a values of 0 is specified. The default is 1000. (Default: 1000)]' \
        '--PCs[The principal components to plot. If specified, you must provide two different integers, greater than zero, separated by a space. An example (and the default) is "1 2". (Default: \[1, 2\])]' \
        '--log2[log2 transform the datapoints prior to computing the PCA. Note that 0.01 is added to all values to prevent 0 values from becoming -infinity. Using this option with input that contains negative values will result in an error.]' \
        '--colors[A list of colors for the symbols. Color names and html hex string (e.g., #eeff22) are accepted. The color names should be space separated. For example, --colors red blue green. If not specified, the symbols will be given automatic colors.]' \
        '--markers[A list of markers for the symbols. (e.g., '\''<'\'','\''>'\'','\''o'\'') are accepted. The marker values should be space separated. For example, --markers '\''s'\'' '\''o'\'' '\''s'\'' '\''o'\''. If not specified, the symbols will be given automatic shapes.]' \
