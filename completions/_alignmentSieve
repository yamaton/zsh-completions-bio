        '--shift[Shift the left and right end of a read (for BAM files) or a fragment (for BED files). A positive value shift an end to the right (on the + strand) and a negative value shifts a fragment to the left. Either 2 or 4 integers can be provided. For example, "2 -3" will shift the left-most fragment end two bases to the right and the right-most end 3 bases to the left. If 4 integers are provided, then the first and last two refer to fragments whose read 1 is on the left or right, respectively. Consequently, it is possible to take strand into consideration for strand-specific protocols. A fragment whose length falls below 1 due to shifting will not be written to the output. See the online documentation for graphical examples. Note that non-properly-paired reads will be filtered.]' \
        '--ATACshift[Shift the produced BAM file or BEDPE regions as commonly done for ATAC-seq. This is equivalent to --shift 4 -5 5 -4.]' \
        '--BED[Instead of producing BAM files, write output in BEDPE format (as defined by MACS2). Note that only reads/fragments passing filtering criterion are written in BEDPE format.]' \
        '--filterRNAstrand[Selects RNA-seq reads (single-end or paired-end) in the given strand. (Default: None)]' \
        '--ignoreDuplicates[If set, reads that have the same orientation and start position will be considered only once. If reads are paired, the mate'\''s position also has to coincide to ignore a read.]' \
        '--minMappingQuality[If set, only reads that have a mapping quality score of at least this are considered.]' \
        '--samFlagInclude[Include reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that are the first mate, use a flag of 64. This is useful to count properly paired reads only once, as otherwise the second mate will be also considered for the coverage.]' \
        '--samFlagExclude[Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to get only reads that map to the forward strand, use --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for reads that map to the reverse strand.]' \
        {--blackListFileName,-bl}'[A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be considered. Please note that you should adjust the effective genome size, if relevant.]':file:_files \
        '--minFragmentLength[The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair inclusion. This option is primarily useful in ATACseq experiments, for filtering mono- or di-nucleosome fragments. (Default: 0)]' \
        '--maxFragmentLength[The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair inclusion. A value of 0 indicates no limit. (Default: 0)]' \
